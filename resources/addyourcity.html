    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>This project took shape over a weekend in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, the gender speaker gap is in no way limited to DC. The research and website are both open source and easily reproducible for your city. The most important element is local advocate(s) to engage the city's tech community. If you think that's you, read on.</p>

  <div class = "connect">
    <h2>Connect</h2>
    Connect with an advocate in another city so they can help you along the way.

    <h2>Collect</h2>
    Annotate the meetup speaker genders from your city's dataset! We created an <a href = "https://flexyford.github.io/WeSpeakTooDashboard/">awesome tool</a> to help you collect it and publish it to data.world.

    <h2>Tell the Story</h3>
      <p>Once you have a dataset, you can visualize it. You can fork the <a href = "https://github.com/WeSpeakToo/weSpeakToo/tree/master/austin/iframes">iframes</a> Kate created for her original analysis by pointing them to your own dataset. </p>

      <p>You can also use a tool like <a href = "https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public</a> to create a public visualization to embed into your writeup.
