			<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<div class = "content col-6">
			<p>Women and non-binary individuals are woefully underrepresented as speakers at professional technology events as shown by recent research in <a href="http://www.datalensdc.com/meetupSpeakers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Washington, DC</a> and <a href="/austin/story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Austin.</a> This lack of representation can have far-reaching effects. <ul><li>Marginalized groups miss out on opportunities to be presented as leaders or experts in their fields.</li> <li>They are less likely to feel welcome to such groups, missing out on valuable learning and networking opportunities.</li></ul>
