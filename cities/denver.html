    <h2>The Story</h2>
  </div>

  <div class = "row">
    <p>Women and non-binary individuals are woefully underrepresented as speakers at professional technology events, as shown by recent research in Washington, DC and Austin. This lack of representation can have far-reaching effects.</p>
    <p class="content">Our Denver SpeakerList is NEW as of July 12, 2017, while the analysis on Denver and Boulder meetup culture is in progress. <a href = "mailto:hello@amaliebarras.com">Let us know</a> if you're interested in collaborating on this effort.</p>

      <h3>Not sure if you should?</h3>
        <p class "small"> HINT: You should.</p>

<p>Public speaking is a great skill to have. Speaking at a professional event can help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>establish yourself in the field,</li>
  <li>expand your skill base,</li>
  <li>make new connections,</li>
  <li>looks great on a resume to boot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Giving a talk is also one of the best ways to solidify knowledge. Beyond personal benefits, the very presence of women and non-binary speakers at professional events can help promote diversity, dispel notions of what an “expert” looks like, and encourage others to join the field or take a more visible role.</p>

<h3>Dispelling some common myths:</h3>
  <p>You don’t need to be an expert to speak on a subject. In fact, sometimes it’s the best way to learn something new! You might not even have found your footing yet. </p>

  <p>One recent tech meetup was a fresh-out-of-undergrad giving a talk on finding a job and his way in the industry.</p>

  <p>You don’t need to have every column filled to be on this list. Don’t have a twitter account? Don’t have a language or software to add? That’s okay!</p>

  <p>There is no baseline for a talk to be “techy” enough. Don’t think your talk or knowledge is “techy” enough? Nonsense! There are many, many backgrounds fit for a good data or tech talk - project management, media, design, and more.</p>

  <p>Public speaking isn’t as scary as you think, and you might even like it. I promise! </p>

  <p>Practice can prove that. Start where you like, maybe a smaller meetup or roundtable discussion. It definitely won’t be a nightmare; you definitely won’t be naked. You can do it!
  </p>

<p>Now that you're convinced, <a href="#addyourself">add yourself to the list!</a></p>
