      <h3>Not sure if you should?</h3>
        <p class "small"> HINT: You should.</p>

      <p>Public speaking is a great skill to have. Speaking at a professional event can help:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>establish yourself in the field,</li>
        <li>expand your skill base,</li>
        <li>make new connections,</li>
        <li>looks great on a resume to boot.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Giving a talk is also one of the best ways to solidify knowledge. Beyond personal benefits, the very presence of women and non-binary speakers at professional events can help promote diversity, dispel notions of what an “expert” looks like, and encourage others to join the field or take a more visible role.</p>

    <h3>Dispelling some common myths:</h3>
      <p>You don’t need to be an expert to speak on a subject. In fact, sometimes it’s the best way to learn something new! You might not even have found your footing yet. </p>

      <p>One recent tech meetup was a fresh-out-of-undergrad giving a talk on finding a job and his way in the industry.</p>

      <p>You don’t need to have every column filled to be on this list. Don’t have a twitter account? Don’t have a language or software to add? That’s okay!</p>

      <p>There is no baseline for a talk to be “techy” enough. Don’t think your talk or knowledge is “techy” enough? Nonsense! There are many, many backgrounds fit for a good data or tech talk - project management, media, design, and more.</p>

      <p>Public speaking isn’t as scary as you think, and you might even like it. I promise! </p>

      <p>Practice can prove that. Start where you like, maybe a smaller meetup or roundtable discussion. It definitely won’t be a nightmare; you definitely won’t be naked. You can do it!
      </p>


      <p>Now that you're convinced, <a href="#addyourself">add yourself to the list!</a></p>
