# weSpeakToo

###DC is often cited as [#1 for women in tech](http://tech.co/dc-is-the-top-city-for-women-in-tech-2016-02). Yet women, along with non-binary people, are [woefully underrepresented](http://www.datalensdc.com/meetupSpeakers.html) as speakers at area professional events.

###http://wespeaktoo.org/ hopes to help close that gap.
It is a list of DC-area women and non-binary people who are interested in speaking at professional data and tech events. Please share this website and encourage women and non-binary people in your life to add themselves!

###How can I add my name to the list?
You can fork this repo and [add your name directly.](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/weSpeakToo/blob/master/speakers.json) You can also [email me](mailto:datalensdc@gmail.com) your information.

### Why should I be on this list?
Public speaking is a great skill to have. Speaking at a professional event can help establish yourself in the field, expand your skill base, make new connections, and looks great on a resume to boot. Giving a talk is also one of the best ways to solidify knowledge. Beyond personal benefits, the very presence of women and non-binary speakers at professional events can help promote diversity, dispel notions of what an "expert" looks like, and encourage others to join the field or take a more visible role.

### Dispelling some common myths
* __You don't need to be an expert to speak on a subject.__ In fact, sometimes it's the best way to learn something new! You might not even have found your footing yet. One recent tech meetup was a fresh-out-of-undergrad giving a talk on finding a job and his way in the industry.
* __You don't need to have every column filled to be on this list.__ Don't have a twitter account? Don't have a language or software to add? That's okay!
* __There is no baseline for a talk to be "techy" enough.__ Don't think your talk or knowledge is "techy" enough? Nonsense! There are many, many backgrounds fit for a good data or tech talk - project management, media, design, and more.
* __Public speaking isn't as scary as you think, and you might even like it.__ I promise! Practice can prove that. Start where you like, maybe a smaller meetup or roundtable discussion. It definitely won't be a nightmare; you definitely won't be naked. You can do it!
